# Lorena Seabra — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This project was built to showcase my journey as a **Software Engineer**, highlighting my **projects, skills, experiences**, and the communities I’ve been part of.

## About the Project

This website serves as a central hub for my professional and academic work — including hackathons, research projects, and tech community involvement.  
It’s designed with a **clean and responsive interface**, offering an elegant way to present my background, achievements, and portfolio.


## Technologies Used

- **React** — for building the interface  
- **TypeScript** — for type safety and scalability  
- **Vite** — for fast build and development setup  
- **CSS / Tailwind / Styled Components** *(depending on your stack)*  
- **GitHub Pages** — for deployment and hosting
